				<h3>Who are we?</h3>
				<p>We are Team 224 of Piscataway, NJ a.k.a. The Tribe.</p>
				<h3>What is our mission?</h3>
				<p>To bring students together as a team in which we build a robot that can compete in a tournament of a given contest. What is this contest/tournament about? We are part of the For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST) organization. In this organization, we are a part of the First Robotics Competition (FRC) league. You can also view the manual for this years competition athttp://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/competition-manual-and-related-documents. To view last year's competition press play in the video below.</p>

				<h3>How do we go about in building our robot?</h3>
				<p>With the help of our mentors (which include graduated high schoolers who were in our robotics team and Rutgers fraternity Sigma Phi Delta), we build and program our robot from scratch. Parts are given to us from FRC and we are sponsored by the Piscataway Board of Ed and MCL. We spend a few weeks planning and prototyping, and the rest of the time building our robot, as well as coding, making improvements along the way.</p>
